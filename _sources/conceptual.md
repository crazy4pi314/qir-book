# What is QIR?
__What is QIR, why we need it, where it is used, and how it is used.__
- "Formal specifications embedded in LLVM..., it expresses quantum specific operations as declared function calls on opaque data types.." {cite}`mlirTN`
- Using a conceptual example, showing what each component of the ecosystem does and how they can be applied to users' needs

__Motivations for QIR Community/ Alliance?__
- What is interoperability?
- Interoperability opens doors to cross-fields problem-solving such as error correction

__Heterogeneous Data in IR__
- QRAM model for circuit-based quantum computation
- How is QIR different from other quantum IRs?

__Why IR?__
- interoperability with specific backends profiles (1:m)
-  HPC backends
-  Optimization passes to classical and quantum code
 {cite}`mlirTN`

__Why LLVM?__
-  LLVM years of R&D
- MLIR quantum dialect
- cqor compiler is in LLVM
- qir spec is in LLVM dialect
- "QIR is embedded in LLVM IR"
-  C++ and Clang for quantum function expression to be at the same level as classical information at IR {cite}`mccaskey2021extending`

__pyqir__
- Emission, Execution, and analysis (py-based PL)= pyqir
- Pyqir matches the code to the defined profiles in QIR and generates .ll
- analysis: resource estimation?
- includes/skip the steps for QIR spec and qcor, for py-based languages
- where LLVM dialect meets/compiles the higher-level instruction to executables

__qir_spec__
- Formalization of Quantum Operation in LLVM
- Type Abstraction and Formalization
- Function call = operations on opaque data types
- Entry point functions

__qcor__
- Movements between abstraction levels (XACC and MLIR dialect)
-  MLIR --> quantum instructions = stand-alone DSL{cite}`mccaskey2021extending`
