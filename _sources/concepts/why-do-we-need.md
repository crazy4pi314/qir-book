# Why do we need it?

## Hybrid quantum programs are the future of quantum computing

- QRAM model for circuit-based quantum computation

## Why an {term}`IR`?

- What is interoperability?
  - Interoperability with specific backends hardware profiles
- Optimization passes to classical and quantum code {cite}`mlirTN`
- Easy to simulate on HPC backends

## Motivations for QIR Community/ Alliance?

- {term}`Interoperability` opens doors to cross-fields problem-solving
